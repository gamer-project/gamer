Compilation flags:
========================================
Enable : MODEL=HYDRO
Disable: COMOVING, PARTICLE, GRAVITY


Default setup:
========================================
1. Refinement criteria: vorticity and regions near the shear plane
2. Maximum refinement level (MAX_LEVEL) = 3


Note:
========================================
1. Adopt the periodic boundary condition
2. Shear velocity is defined on the x-y plane
3. Random values are added to velocity in all three directions
4. yt script "plot_density.py" for visualization
5. Must disable "OPT__INIT_GRID_WITH_OMP"
   --> Otherwise all threads would share the same random seed
