Compilation flags:
========================================
Enable : MODEL=SR_HYDRO, FLOAT8
Disable: COMOVING, PARTICLE, GRAVITY


Default setup:
========================================
1. Resolution = 64^3
2. Run for one period


Note:
========================================
1. Only support the 3D case, where the wave propagates along the diagonal direction
   --> Simulation box must be cubic
2. A simple gnuplot script "plot.gpt" is attached
3. "Record__L1Err" records the L1 errors
4. AcousticWave_*_* record the numerical and analytical solutions along the diagonal
