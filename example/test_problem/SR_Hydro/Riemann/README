Default setup:
========================================
1. Resolution = 64x16x16, with MAX_LEVEL=2
2. Lohner's refinement threshold = 0.50 (on density)


Note:
========================================
1. Since GAMER does not support real 1D/2D simulations, please set the
   root-level grid size to 16 (i.e., patch size*2) for the directions
   perpendicular to the wave propagation direction.
