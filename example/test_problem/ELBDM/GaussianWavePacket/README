Compilation flags:
========================================
Enable : MODEL=ELBDM
Disable: GRAVITY, PARTICLE


Default setup:
========================================
1. Evolve the Gaussian wave packet for half of box
2. Apply the analytical solution as user-defined BC
   --> Set OPT__BC_FLU_* = 4


Note:
========================================
1. Only support 1D --> Use "Gau_XYZ" to control the propagation direction
2. Also support periodic BC --> Set "Gau_PeriodicN" to add periodic images and set OPT__BC_FLU_* = 1
3. For ELBDM_SCHEME = ELBDM_HYBRID
   a. When there are more than one periodic images (Gau_PeriodicN > 0),
      the analytical solution of the unwrapped phase may be wrong due to self-interference
      after t > 6.0*Gau_Width*ELBDM_ETA*BoxSize[Gau_XYZ]/(2*M_PI)
      and a lack of periodicity if the number of images is not enough
   b. The periodic BC (OPT__BC_FLU_* = 1) does not work for Gaussian wave packets that are
      - travelling
      - non-travelling but non-periodic
   c. The default setup may lead to "time-step is too small" error
      --> Try a larger Gau_Width to avoid it
   d. The default setup is without refinement and adopts the fluid scheme;
      When setting MAX_LEVEL > 0, the refinement is based on OPT__FLAG_INTERFERENCE
      and the refined levels adopt the wave scheme while the base level adopts the fluid scheme
