Compilation flags:
========================================
Enable : MODEL=ELBDM, HYBRID, GRAVITY
Disable: PARTICLE, COMOVING

Default setup:
========================================
1. Study gravitational collapse in one, two and three dimensions (2D by default)
2. Use periodic boundary conditions
3. Demonstrate refinement in hybrid scheme by using Input__Flag_Interference
4. Compared to JeansInstabilityComoving, this test also supports 1D, 2D and 3D collapse

Note:
========================================
1. Evolve small-amplitude plane waves on homogeneous background density
2. Perturbation_Amplitude is maximum amplitude of individual perturbations, Perturbation_BgAmplitude is amplitude of background density, Perturbation_N is number of Fourier modes in perturbation (maximum is 4)
3. Dimensionality of the problem can be set via Perturbation_NDim (set amplitude of plane waves in other dimensions to zero)
3. For reference simulation using base-level spectral method, use MODEL = WAVE and Input__Parameter_BaseSpectral and generate_make_BaseSpectral.sh
