Compilation flags:
========================================
Enable : MODEL=HYDRO, PARTICLE, GRAVITY, DUAL_ENERGY
Disable: COMOVING


Simulation setup:
========================================
1. Units:
   (1) External (for Input__TestProb only):
       See the comment of each runtime variable

   (2) Internal (for all other input files and internal usage):
       [L] = kpc
       [M] = 1.0e9 Msun
       [T] = Myr
    -->[V] = [L]/[T] ~ 9.8e2 km/s
    -->[D] = [M]/[D]^3 ~ 6.8e-23 g/cm^3

2.  Low-resolution default setup
   (1) Download the low-resolution initial conditions and Input_* by executing "sh download_ic_low_res.sh"
   (2) Default resolution ~ 80 pc (root grid 128^3; MAX_LEVEL = 7)

3.  High-resolution setup
   (1) Download the high-resolution initial conditions and Input_* by executing "sh download_ic_high_res.sh"
   (2) Highest resolution ~ 20 pc (root grid 128^3; MAX_LEVEL = 9)
   (3) This setup reproduces the AGORA high-resolution run presented in the GAMER-2 paper (Schive et al. 2018)

3. The low-resolution initial condition files from "sh download_ic_low_res.sh" are the same initial conditions used
   in the "AgoraGalaxy" test problem of Enzo
4. Some handy yt analysis scripts are put at "yt_script"
5. Supernovae feedback (with compilation option `FEEDBACK` enabled) is not officially supported for now
   - The default star particle masses are too large to use `FB_RESOLVED_SNEII` physically
   - Vaslues of `FB_RESOLVED_SNEII_N_PER_MASS` and `FB_RESOLVED_SNEII_DELAY_TIME` are unphysical
     and are only for testing the implementation of SN event rate (with `plot_SN_feedback_rate.py`)
