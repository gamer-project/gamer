Compilation flags:
========================================
Enable  : MODEL=HYDRO, PARTICLE, TRACER, GRAVITY,
          SUPPORT_HDF5
Disable : COMOVING


Default setup:
========================================
1. Maximum refinement level (MAX_LEVEL = 3)
2. Both massive and tracer particles enabled

Note:
========================================
1. Test particle capabilities: 2-body circular orbit for massive particles, a
   lattice of tracer particles which rotates due to a circular velocity field
   from the fluid with constant angular frequency
2. Set ParTest_Use_Tracers = 1 to use tracer particles, ParTest_Use_Massive = 1
   to use massive particles. At least one must be enabled.
3. No need to set PAR_NPAR in Input__Parameter since it will be reset automatically.
3. OPT__FREEZE_FLUID must be = 1 for this test.
4. If OPT__FLAG_USER is set, a rectangle will be refined in the center of the
   domain. Note that the active particle orbit is _not_ stable in this case due
   to self-force at refinement boundaries.
5. Density of the gas must be kept very small to avoid gravitational effects from
   the gas.
6. Use python script "make_tracer_pngs.py" with yt to make PNG images, use
   bash script "make_tracer_movie.sh" to combine PNGs into movies with ffmpeg.
