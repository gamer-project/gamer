Compilation flags:
========================================
Enable : MODEL=HYDRO [MHD]
Disable: GRAVITY, PARTICLE


Default setup:
========================================
1. Resolution = 64x16x16, with MAX_LEVEL=2
2. Lohner's refinement threshold = 0.50 (on density)
   --> May not be suitable for all Riemann problems here
3. Outflow boundary condition


Note:
========================================
1. Since GAMER does not support real 1D/2D simulations, one should set the
   root-level grid size to 16 (i.e., patch size*2) in the transverse directions
2. Enable MHD in the Makefile for the Riemann problems involving magnetic field
3. Plotting scripts: plot__hydro_dens.gpt, plot__mhd.gpt
4. The analytical solution of ReferenceSolution/Gamma_1.67/BrioWu adopts a
   regular solution (a rotational wave) at x~0.495 while numerical simulations
   usually lead to a non-regular solution (a compound wave)
