Compilation flags:
========================================
Enable : MODEL=HYDRO, GRAVITY,  PARTICLE
Disable: COMOVING


Default setup:
========================================


Note:
========================================
Test the evolution of different kinds of models
   --> NFW, Burkert, Hernquist, Einasto, Jaffe models are available
   --> You can also choose "UNKNOWN" model, and assign a file of density profile


User guide:
========================================
1. Edit Input__Models to tell gamer how many clouds you want to simulate,
   and their parameter filenames, model type, and density profile name(only when model type=="UNKNOWN")
   In detail,
   (1) Models_num is the number of all clouds.
   (2) Models_Paras is the filename of parameters of different clouds.
   (3) Models_Type is the model type of the clouds, available options are:
      NFW
      Burkert
      Hernquist
      Einasto
      Jaffe
      UNKNOWN
   (4) Models_Profile is the filename for density profile, which is set to be NONE unless Models_Type==UNKNOWN

2. Edit all the files, whose names are metioned in Input__Models as Models_Paras.
3. Give the density profile files for UNKNOWN model clouds.
