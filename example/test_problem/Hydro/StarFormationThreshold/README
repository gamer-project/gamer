Compilation flags:
========================================
Enable : MODEL=HYDRO, PARTICLE, GRAVITY, STAR_FORMATION
Disable: COMOVING


Default setup:
========================================
1. Units:
   (1) External (for Input__TestProb only):
       See the comment of each runtime variable

   (2) Internal (for all other input files and internal usage):
       [L] = kpc
       [M] = 1.0e9 Msun
       [T] = Myr
    -->[V] = [L]/[T] ~ 9.8e2 km/s
    -->[D] = [M]/[D]^3 ~ 6.8e-23 g/cm^3


Note:
========================================
1. The initial conditions is a distribution of varying mass density and temperature
   - Linearly varying log( mass density ) in the x direction
   - Linearly varying log( temperature ) in the y direction
   - No variation in the z direction

2. Both the fluid and the particles are freezed and
   the fluid is reset to the initial condition every step by default to keep a constant environment
   - One can also set OPT__RESET_FLUID = 0 to see how the fluid decreases and is converted into stars

3. This is to test the star formation conditions that star should only form at the allowed region
   - SF_CREATE_STAR_SCHEME = 1 -> the minimum gas density (SF_CREATE_STAR_MIN_GAS_DENS)
   - SF_CREATE_STAR_SCHEME = 2 -> the maximum gas Jeans length (SF_CREATE_STAR_MAX_GAS_JEANSL)

4. The default time step is set to 0.1x the free-fall time of the max density

5. In the default setup, the maximum gas cell mass is about 3356870 Msun
   - With SF_CREATE_STAR_MASS_EFF = 1.0e-2 and dt~0.1 free-fall time,
     the maximum star mass is about 3357 Msun,
     which is larger than SF_CREATE_STAR_MIN_STAR_MASS = 1000 Msun
   - The formed star mass in a fixed time step is proportional to (gas density)^(3/2)
     according to the local Schmidt star formation law
   - When the expected star mass is less than SF_CREATE_STAR_MIN_STAR_MASS, the star forms stochastically

6. Some handy yt analysis scripts are put at "yt_script"
