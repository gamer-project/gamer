Compilation flags:
========================================
Enable : MODEL=HYDRO, PARTICLE, GRAVITY, DUAL_ENERGY, STAR_FORMATION
Disable: COMOVING


Default setup:
========================================
1. Units:
   (1) External (for Input__TestProb only):
       See the comment of each runtime variable

   (2) Internal (for all other input files and internal usage):
       [L] = kpc
       [M] = 1.0e9 Msun
       [T] = Myr
    -->[V] = [L]/[T] ~ 9.8e2 km/s
    -->[D] = [M]/[D]^3 ~ 6.8e-23 g/cm^3


Note:
========================================
1. The initial conditions is a distribution of varying mass density and temperature
   - Linearly varying log( mass density ) in the x direction
   - Linearly varying log( temperature ) in the y direction
   - No variation in the z direction

2. Both the fluid and the particles are freezed and the fluid is reset to the initial condition every step

3. This is to test the star formation conditions that star should only form at the allowed region
   - SF_CREATE_STAR_SCHEME = 1 -> the minimum gas density (SF_CREATE_STAR_MIN_GAS_DENS)
   - SF_CREATE_STAR_SCHEME = 2 -> the maximum gas Jeans length (SF_CREATE_STAR_MAX_GAS_JEANSL)

4. The default time step is set to the free-fall time of the max density

5. In the default setup, the maximum gas cell mass is about 3356870 Msun
   - With SF_CREATE_STAR_MASS_EFF = 1.0e-2 and dt~0.1 free-fall time,
     the maximum star mass is about 3357 Msun,
     which is larger than SF_CREATE_STAR_MIN_STAR_MASS = 1000 Msun
   - The formed star mass in a fixed time step is proportional to (gas density)^(3/2)
     according to the local Schmidt star formation law
   - When the expected star mass is less than SF_CREATE_STAR_MIN_STAR_MASS, the star forms stochastically

6. Some handy yt analysis scripts are put at "yt_script"
