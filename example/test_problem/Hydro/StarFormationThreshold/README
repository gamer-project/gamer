Compilation flags:
========================================
Enable : MODEL=HYDRO, PARTICLE, GRAVITY, DUAL_ENERGY, STAR_FORMATION
Disable: COMOVING


Default setup:
========================================
1. Units:
   (1) External (for Input__TestProb only):
       See the comment of each runtime variable

   (2) Internal (for all other input files and internal usage):
       [L] = kpc
       [M] = 1.0e9 Msun
       [T] = Myr
    -->[V] = [L]/[T] ~ 9.8e2 km/s
    -->[D] = [M]/[D]^3 ~ 6.8e-23 g/cm^3


Note:
========================================
1. The initial conditions is a exponential distribution of varying mass density and temperature
   - Varying the mass density in x axis
   - Varying the temperature in y axis
2. This is to test the star formation conditions
3. Some handy yt analysis scripts are put at "yt_script"
