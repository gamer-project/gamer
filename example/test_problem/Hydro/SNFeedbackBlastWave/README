Compilation flags:
========================================
Enable : MODEL=HYDRO, GRAVITY, PARTICLE, FEEDBACK
Disable: COMOVING


Default setup:
========================================
1. Units:
   (1) External (for Input__TestProb only):
       See the comment of each runtime variable

   (2) Internal (for all other input files and internal usage):
       [L] = kpc
       [M] = 1.0e9 Msun
       [T] = Myr
    -->[V] = [L]/[T] ~ 9.8e2 km/s
    -->[D] = [M]/[L]^3 ~ 6.8e-23 g/cm^3

2. Default maximum resolution ~ 3.5 pc (root grid 32^3; MAX_LEVEL = 3)

3. Refinement criteria
   (1) Numer of particles in each cell
       --> Refinement threshold = 0
       --> Particle has to be in the MAX_LEVEL to have feedback
   (2) Lohner's error estimator on pressure
       --> Refinement threshold = 0.80


Note:
========================================
1. To test the effect of the Type II supernova feedback when the star particle explodes in a typical ISM environment
   - SN locally deposits thermal energy, mass, metal into the surrounding gas (only one cell) at a given delay time
   - The parameters for the feedback can be set in `Input__Parameter` --> See `FB_RESOLVED_SNEII*` for details
   - There is only one particle and its initial mass, metal fraction, position, and velocity can be set in `Input__TestProb`
   - The density, temperature, and metal fraction for the background ISM gas can be set in `Input__TestProb`
2. The results are similar to the `Hydro/BlastWave` test problem
   - To compare the default results, use the input files provided in `ForBlastWave/` to run `Hydro/BlastWave` test problem
   - Set `FB_RESOLVED_SNEII_EJECT_MASS` = 0.0 to only deposit energy
3. The self-gravity is off (`OPT__SELF_GRAVITY=0`); The compilatin option GRAVITY is enabled only to have a star particle
4. Plot scripts are attached:
   - `plot_diag.gpt` to plot the density along the diagonal line for the blast wave profile
   - `plot_slice_gas.py` to plot the slices of density, temperature, and metal density and to check the amount of deposited energy and metal
